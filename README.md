# Optical-Fibre-Ciphering-using-OpenCV
 Program that used OpenCV library and Pygame to convert light flashes into text and text into light flashes. OpenCV library was used to read light flashes from the camera and convert them into binary. Using ASCII, this encrypted data was converted to text.  
Using
Pygame, an input text was converted to flashes on the screen, “0”
corresponding to black and “1" to white . The text was first converted to
binary using ASCII.
